### Technologies Used
Our project leverages a robust tech stack including React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS for a lightweight, scalable, and visually appealing frontend. The backend utilizes Firestore, a NoSQL cloud-native document database, ensuring real-time synchronization and flexible data models across CRP platforms. We designed the architecture to facilitate cloud monitoring with Firebase real-time analytics and Google Cloud Monitoring synthetics, alongside easy cloud-based hosting via Firebase. Our service layer, exposed via FastAPI, maintains a modular separation of business logic for improved security and scalability. For authentication and security, we implement multiple control layers, including Firebase Auth, role-based access control (RBAC), and JWT, while our backend manages access to sensitive information. Additionally, we incorporate AI-native features such as a chatbot powered by large language models (LLMs) and AI-based matchmaking using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and natural language processing (NLP), complemented by content moderation filters.
