## TThe Community Restoration Project
The mission of The Community Restoration Project Corp (CRP) is to provide families and individuals the resources to live productive lives. The programs offered by CRP ensure that families and individuals have the tools they need to make this possible

### Problem Statement

The Community Restoration Project seeks to improve social capital within their housing programs by having town hall meetings, community events,and volunteer opportunities within our organization. Social Capital for our organization is improving neighbor relations, intercommunity relationships, and rapport with staff.

### Our Solution
Our team developed a full-stack web app integrating features such as FAQ-based chatbot, requests and suggestions forum, social matchmaking and community-based calendar and chat to improve Community Restoration Project (CRP)’s impact on Atlanta housing and restoration. Our project aims to increase community engagement, enhance communication efficiency, improve social capital, empower financial stability, and optimize community support effectiveness within The Community Restoration Project.

### Features 
- **FAQ-based Chatbot**: Automates FAQ responses and integrates with the suggestions portal to streamline user interactions, reducing workload and enhancing user experience.
- **Suggestions Portal**: Enables users to submit queries, concerns, and feedback directly to CRP. Implements two-way communication between members and staff, fostering community-driven issue reporting and support.
- **Interactive Calendar**: Interactive events calendar with sign-ups, leveraging React and embedded Google Calendar for seamless event management.
- **User Profiles**: Managed by staff approval, user profiles feature essential details and enable tracking of active community members, ensuring robust community management.
- **Social Matchmaking**: Facilitates community engagement by matching users based on shared interests, promoting connections and activities like coffee meetups and more.

### Technologies Used
Our project leverages a robust tech stack including React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS for a lightweight, scalable, and visually appealing frontend. The backend utilizes Firestore, a NoSQL cloud-native document database, ensuring real-time synchronization and flexible data models across CRP platforms. We designed the architecture to facilitate cloud monitoring with Firebase real-time analytics and Google Cloud Monitoring synthetics, alongside easy cloud-based hosting via Firebase. Our service layer, exposed via FastAPI, maintains a modular separation of business logic for improved security and scalability. For authentication and security, we implement multiple control layers, including Firebase Auth, role-based access control (RBAC), and JWT, while our backend manages access to sensitive information. Additionally, we incorporate AI-native features such as a chatbot powered by large language models (LLMs) and AI-based matchmaking using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and natural language processing (NLP), complemented by content moderation filters.
